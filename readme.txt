Responsive Tables

This module was developed as part of Lane Community College's (http://www.lanecc.edu) migration to Drupal. We found that it did not meet our needs, but wanted to provide it for others to use as they see fit.

The technique used is originally described on http://www.zurb.com/article/982/a-new-take-on-responsive-tables
